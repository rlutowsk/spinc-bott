 * @param n   The number of vertices in the graph (matrix is n x n).
 * @return    Pointer to a statically allocated string containing the d6 encoding.

/**
 * @brief Fills a matrix from a d6-encoded graph string.
 *
 * This function decodes a graph represented in the "d6" format (a compact
 * graph encoding) and fills the provided matrix with the adjacency information.
 * The matrix is assumed to be an array of `vec_t` values, where each entry
 * represents a row of the adjacency matrix as a bit vector.
 *
 * @param s    Pointer to the d6-encoded graph string. The string must start with '&'.
 * @param mat  Pointer to the matrix (array of `vec_t`) to be filled. The matrix
 *             should have space for at least `dim` rows.
 * @param dim  The dimension (number of rows/columns) of the matrix.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, -1 on error (e.g., invalid input string or dimension).
 *
 * The function expects the following:
 *   - The input string `s` is in the correct d6 format.
 *   - The matrix `mat` is pre-allocated and large enough to hold the result.
 *   - The function initializes the matrix to zero before filling it.

 *
 * The function allocates and initializes a nauty graph structure from the input matrix,
 * skipping rows with no outgoing edges. It then generates the canonical form of the digraph
