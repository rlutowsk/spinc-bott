# Counting spinc structures on real Bott manifolds

The applications counts the numbers of real Bott manifolds with spinc and spin structures in given dimension.

It is designed to use OpenMP and gcc compiler.

## Invoking

After compiling, you may use the following switches:

	- d: with argument being the dimension you want to check
	- j: with argument being number of threads to use
	- v: increase communicates that are printed after job is done
	- h: show short help
